# c-program-to-upload-and-edit-xml-document-in-a-server-cloent-model
Editing and uploading xml files in a client server model

In this program we look at the process of uploading an XML file from client 
side to server side after which another authorized user can view and edit 
the file. The parts of the file edited are saved in a log file as well as 
the user who made the changes.
The program also has a functionality to perform a backup of the files 
available in the server at a specific backup time.
The program is coded purely in c language
